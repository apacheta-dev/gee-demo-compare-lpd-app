# Land Productivity Dynamics Maps Comparison Tool – DEMO for Haiti

This repository contains the source code for a **Google Earth Engine (GEE) App** designed to **analyze land degradation due to changes in land productivity**, supporting the computation of **SDG indicator 15.3.1** (Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area).

The app focuses on the **land productivity sub-indicator** of SDG 15.3.1 and supports analysis workflows aligned with **UNCCD reporting through the PRAIS platform**.

## 🔗 Live Demo

A deployed example of the application is available here:

👉 https://apacheta.projects.earthengine.app/view/compare-lpd-hti

The demo illustrates land degradation analysis based on **Land Productivity Dynamics (LPD)** for the computation of **SDG indicator 15.3.1**.

## 📌 About

This project provides a **Google Earth Engine application** to analyze **land degradation caused by changes in vegetation productivity**, enabling the comparison of multiple LPD products and the calculation of productivity statistics required to compute **SDG indicator 15.3.1**.

The app is aligned with the **UNCCD Good Practice Guidance** and supports workflows used in the **PRAIS reporting platform**, where land productivity is one of the three core sub-indicators of SDG 15.3.1.

The repository includes a modular GEE application for interactive comparison of different LPD products and NDVI series available for analysis.

## 📁 App Folder: `app-lpd`

The `app-lpd` folder contains **all scripts required for the GEE application to function**.  
The app is responsible for visualization, interaction, and summarization of **LPD maps and statistics**.

### `app.js`
- Main entry point of the application.
- Initializes map panels, UI layout, and interactions.
- Connects LPD products, reporting periods, and statistics.
- This is the script executed in the GEE Code Editor to run the app or to publish it.

### `legends.js`
- Defines reusable functions to build legends and layer controls.

### `localization.js`
- Stores all user interface labels.
- Supports multiple languages.
- Facilitates adaptation to national reporting contexts without modifying the app logic.

### `precalculation.js`
- Defines the **land productivity sub-indicator configuration for SDG 15.3.1**.
- Specifies:
  - LPD products and methods (e.g. JRC, FAO–WOCAT, Trends.Earth, ML30, HiLPD).
  - Reporting periods.
- Controls how LPD statistics are computed.

### `precalculation_sample.js`
- Intended as a starting point for adapting the app to new countries and running all LPD statistics.

## 📁 LPD Products and Processing

The app supports the comparison of several widely used LPD methodologies derived from multi-temporal NDVI series, including:

- **Trends.Earth (UNCCD Default Method)**
- **FAO–WOCAT LPD v2 (Priority, Balance and Broad Detection modes)**
- **JRC LPD**
- **ML30 – Mixed Landsat 30 m LPD**
- **HiLPD – CBAS 30 m**

These products are harmonized into the standard UNCCD LPD classes:

1. Declining  
2. Moderate decline  
3. Stable but stressed  
4. Stable  
5. Increasing  

Outputs generated by the preprocessing scripts are exported as **Earth Engine assets**, which are then consumed by the GEE App.

## 🌍 How to Adapt This App for a New Country

1. Open the **Google Earth Engine Code Editor**:  
   https://code.earthengine.google.com
2. Copy the contents of the `app-lpd` folder into your GEE repository and update script file paths accordingly.
3. Update country-specific terminology and labels in `localization.js`.
4. Prepare or import the required NDVI and LPD assets for your country.
5. Adapt `precalculation.js` to select the LPD products and reporting periods to be evaluated.
6. Replace the FeatureCollections in `precalculation_sample.js`, run the script, and export the resulting LPD statistics.
7. Update the precalculated collections referenced in `app.js`, then run the script to launch the app and explore maps and statistics.
8. Publish the app (optional).
